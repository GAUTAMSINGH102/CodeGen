## Demo

### Code conversion
- In first-line write from which language you want to Convert and to which language you want to Convert in. (Preferably commented)
- In the second line write the "From_Language_Name" followed by a colon (":"). (Preferably commented)
- From the third line onwards write your code.
- The last line will be "To_Language_Name" followed by a colon (":"). (Preferably commented)
- Now select the whole text and Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
- Select `CodeGen: Convert code`
Format:
```bash
  "From_Language_Name" to "To_Language_Name"
  "From_Language_Name:"
   Your_Code
  "To_Language_Name:"
```

### Generate code from instructions
- Write proper step-wise instructions to get the desired result.
- Use any language for writing instructions, here I've shown two demos, one in English and one in Hindi.
- Now select the whole text and Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
- Select `CodeGen: Write code`


### Generate documentation
- [imp.] Leave at least one empty line at the bottom of your selected text and do not include this empty line in your selection. (Else whole code will be commented out)
- Now select the required code snippets for its documentation and Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
- Select `CodeGen: Generate documentation`



### Semantic search
- [imp.] Do not search in a file having more than 1800 tokens, search on a small file as this API have a limit for now hence request will get failed if the limit exceeds.
- Open any file and Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
- Select `CodeGen: Do semantic search`, an input search box will appear.
- Search anything with logical sense and Press `Enter`.
- Whichever line is making most sense with your search will be get highlighted with viewpoint centered.
